This project is not actively maintained any more!

This project started with the intention to provide an easy way to install
ownCloud on the Raspberry Pi. When I started this project owncloud was 
not in the official repos of Raspbian but for quite some time now ownCloud
can be installed from the rasbian repos.


HOW TO USE:

1. Clone this repo: git clone https://github.com/popeye123/APIS.git
2. Change directory: cd APIS
3. Run the script: sudo ./main.sh
4. Update the script (optional): git pull && sudo ./main.sh update


HOW TO TRANSLATE:

0. This procedure applies to all languages ​​other than English. If you want
   to change some of the English translations, you have to do it directly in
   the code.

1. Change directory:
	cd APIS

2. Run following command if APIS is not yet translated into your language:
	./translate_helper init "yourLanguage"

   If APIS has been translated already run the following command to update
   .po files:
	./translate_helper po "yourLanguage"

3. translate the po file (./po/yourLanguage/apis.po)

4. Create the .mo file (compile .po file):
	./translate_helper mo "yourLanguage"
